### HTML, CSS, JS Skills
As a digital marketing analyst, knowledge of how a website is built and struture comes in handy.

To that end, I put together several websites with different technology stack. Here some of them

Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. It uses preconfiguration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, intelligent image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching.

https://www.testandoptimize.com is the marketing site with landing pages, blog for my consultancy business as a digital web analyst
