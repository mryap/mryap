### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a digital marketing analyst, knowledge of how a website is built and struture comes in handy.

To that end, I put together several websites with different technology stack. Here some of them


#### Gatsby
Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator. It uses preconfiguration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, intelligent image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching.

https://www.testandoptimize.com is the marketing site with landing pages, blog for my consultancy business as a digital web analyst 

To prepare for an interview a role I applied, I cobbled together https://peaceful-torvalds-71aa64.netlify.app/blog/  
The role I applied require a deep understanding of components, page structures. I was not short-listed for the 2nd round of interview. 

#### Jekyll 
Like Gatsby, Jekyll is another open source static site generator. Unlike CMS such as Drupal and WordPress, Jekyll site generates all the content at once. 
Instead of waiting for people to visit your website's pages and for content to be pulled from CMS (involving a database) and render on the fly
